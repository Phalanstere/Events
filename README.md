# LoopedEvents


<img src="http://burckhardt.ludicmedia.de/LoopedEvents/LoopedEvents.png">

The basic idea of this package (which will be embedded in the <a href = "https://github.com/Planeshifter/liquid-screen">liquidScreen</a> package, is to make animations easy.

##<a href="http://burckhardt.ludicmedia.de/LoopedEvents">Demo</a>##

The easiest way is to to use the integrated editor.
If you want to have a more detailed look how to add events, have a look at the <a href = "https://github.com/Phalanstere/loopedEvents/wiki/0.-Looped-Events">wiki</a>


##Installation

```javascript
	npm install looped-events
```


##Usage

First you require the library:

```javascript
	var loop = require('looped-events');
	
``` 
 
##Utilizing it in your project

If you want to use the **LoopedEvents** editor, the best starting point would be the minimal files you find in the **minimal** folder. 
 
 A **minimal html file** with an embedded editor looks like this:
 
 

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>LoopedEvents Minimal</title>

	<link rel="stylesheet" href="node_modules/looped-events/css/interface.css">
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="node_modules/looped-events/css/codemirror.css">
	<script src="bundle.js"></script> 
 
  </body>
</html>
```   
  
The minimal **index.js** file would look like this:

```javascript
	var $               = require('jquery');
	var loop            = require('looped-events');
	
	 $(document).ready(function(){
        "use strict";

      
        var events = [];
        
        var e = {
        type: "greensock",  
        div: "Sample",     // this  preupposes that a Sample div is existent  
        time: 1000,
        duration: 2000,
        background: "red",
        }; 

        events.push(e);
        
        
        animator = new loop.Animator({
                                loop: true,
                                events: events,
                                interval: 60, 
                                autostart: true,
                                development: true,
                                templateFile: './node_modules/looped-events/templates/text_effects.tmp.json'
                            });


	});

  ```    
  
 In the **minimal** folder you will find a complete framework that will allow you to set up a minimal project. 
 

##Browserify 

In order to use it, you have to browserify your project. The command that does it is:

```javascript
browserify -t browserify-css lib/index.js > bundle.js
 
 // and for the minified version
browserify -t lib/index.js | uglifyjs > bundle.min.js
``` 

##Creating the animator object

You may have a multitude of animator objects - and there are varios ways of creating them.
So have a look at the parameters:
 
```javascript
     var animator = new loop.Animator({
                                loop: true,
                                events: events,
                                interval: 60, 
                                autostart: true,
                                development: true,
                                fixed: false,
                                templateFile: './node_modules/looped-events/templates/collected.tmp.json'
                            });
```  

- the **loop** parameters sets if the animation shall be repeated till it's stopped. (If you want to start manually, you invoke: **animator.start()**, if you want to stop: 
  **animator.pause()**. Calling **animator.rewind()** goes back to start. 
- the **events** parameters takes an array of events. You might create this manually but usually you would pass a json file. This will be explained later.
- the **interval** parameter determines the ms after which the player loop is invoked again
- **autostart** - set it to true if you want to start the animation immediately
- **development** - when you set this as true you will see the editor at the bottom of your browser window
- **fixed** - setting fixed as true will cause the editor to stick at the bottom, setting it to false whill make it dynamic. Hovering over the bottom of the screen will make the editor appear, leaving it will cause it to disappear      
- **templateFile** - The template file is crucial, since you can use a lot of templates and don't have to worry about writing events manually. If you omit this field, the editor will use the internal database. But if you do this right from the start it will be empty. 
 
###Working with the ditor

In the wiki you find a little explanation how to work with the <a href = "https://github.com/Phalanstere/loopedEvents/wiki/1.-Working-with-the-Editor">editor</a>
 
##Extending the templates

 
When you are working with the **editor**, you may save your json-files in the browser file system (via the great <a href = "https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb">**nedb**</a> library.
When you click on the **cube** icon, you can see all your templates. Copy paste them and store them as a *.json file.
Now you can use your own templates.

##Storing and loading events

When you click on the **info** button of the eidtor, you can see all your events in json-format. Copy paste them and store them in your own **myevents.json** file (or whatever it is called) 
The settings of your projects will also be encapsulated.

This allows you to start your animator after a particular \*.json file has been read in, like this:

```javascript
       $.ajax({
          url: "myevents.json",
          cache: false,
          dataType: "json",
          success: function(data){
            if ( typeof(data) === "object")
                {
                if (data.interval && data.loop)
                    {
                    var m = new loop.Animator(data);
                    window.animator = m;
                    }
                else alert("it seems this is no valid LoopedEvents format");
                }
          },
          error: function(e, xhr){
            alert("PROBLEME ");
          }
        });

  ```  
  
The idea behind this is that you may trigger a lot of animations during runtime - and that you may want to have a multitude of animator objects.
   
##Development

However, this way of invoking the animator objects just makes sense if you want to go into production. 
For development there is an easier way to store your animations. 

You just click on the **diskette** icon, give your animation a name and then it will be stored in the local database.

You may also merge building blocks into a bigger animation. Say you have an **svg.json** animation and want to add it to your animation at 0'48'', you go to the console and write: 

```javascript
	loopedEvents.interface.merge_file("svg.json", 48000); 
  ```  

**loopedEvents** is a windows.global


##Format

When your are working with the editor you have to be aware, that the internal representation in the <a href = "https://codemirror.net/">**CodeMirror**</a href> window 
does not follow the javascript, but json notation. So all the properties have to be written in brackets:

```javascript
"color": "red"
  ```     
instead of  
 
```javascript
color: "red"
  ```    
and you have to be careful with the trailing comma.

If your syntax is not correct the editor simply will not store it.


#Features

The style properties you can manipulate with the loopedEvents library are endless. It allows almost everything, that you can do with the **Greensock** library.
Much slower, but also supported: the **JQUery** library. 
Another cool library -which is embedded is **Raphael** (mainly for the treatment of svg graphics)  
One very nice feature: There is a template that allows ** progressive \*.svg painting**   

Since the power of loopedEvents depends upon the multitude of usable templates, it makes sense to extend the template system.
